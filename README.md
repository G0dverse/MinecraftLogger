# MinecraftLogger
Do you want a minecraft bot that logs who joins and leaves a certain server? (cracked servers only!) well here it is!

# How to use (windows):
1. Install node from https://nodejs.org/en.
2. During the wizard installation choose where you want node to be (i will use documents for example).
3. After installation is done download the src i made.
4. Unzip the src of the bot.
5. Copy (or move fully) the config & index files to whereever you placed node (i will use documents for example).
6. Change the config file options to however you want.
7. Run powershell as adminstrator.
8. Open documents using "cd documents".
9. Check if the code is there using "ls".
10. Then run the index.js using "node index.js".


# Notes:
1. You must have the version of minecraft you want to use installed on you device.
2. You must of already logged on the server using the cracked username.
3. You need to use the same password you used to login in the config file.
4. I set the bot to move 14 blocks when it starts to work.
5. The bot has Automatic /login command with a five second delay.

6. # Enjoy!
